we are using gsap libraby for animations



var tl = gsap.timeline();
tl.to("#page1", {
    y:"100vh",
    scale:0.6,
    duration:0
})

tl.to("#page1", {
    y:"0vh",
    duration:1,
    delay:1
})

tl.to("#page1", {
    y:"0vh",
    rotate:360,
    scale:1,
    duration:0.8
})

// 1. The animation begins with the element "page1" initially positioned at the top of the page.

// 2. The first animation sequence moves the element down from its initial position to a position at the bottom of the viewport (100% of the viewport height). The element is also scaled down to 0.6 times its original size. This animation has a duration of 0 seconds, meaning it happens instantly.

// 3. After the first animation, there is a delay of 1 second.

// 4. The second animation sequence moves the element up from its current position at the bottom of the viewport to a position that is 30% of the viewport height from the top. This animation has a duration of 1 second.

// 5. Finally, the third animation sequence moves the element back to its original position at the top of the page (y: "0vh") while simultaneously rotating it 360 degrees. The element's scale is also restored to its original size. This animation has a duration of 0.8 seconds.// 

In summary, the element starts at the top, moves down to the bottom with scaling, then moves up to a specific position while rotating.
